# Color By Confidence
> A small program to color residues in VMD based on the plddt confidence score assigned to the by Alphafold

### Files
This requires both the ```.pkl``` and ```.pdb``` file generated by AlphaFold. They will typically look something like ```ranked_0.pdb``` and ```result_model_1_pred_0.pkl```, and of both these files may be found in ```./example-data```. Note that each generated PDB file must be paired with its corresponding PKL file or the output will be useless. 

### Running the Program
```bash
python extract_from_pkl.py <your file>.pkl
```
which will generate a file called ```<your file>_vmd.csv```

Next, the PDB and CSV files must be specified in the TCL script. At the top of ```color_by_confidence.tcl``` change:
```
set structure_file "<your pdb>.pdb"
set color_file "<your csv>_vmd.csv"
```

And in the VMD TK console run
```
source color_by_confidence.tcl
```

This should load and center the PDB file specified in the file. Finally, go into VMD's Graphics > Representations > Coloring Method and select "Beta" from the dropdown menu.
